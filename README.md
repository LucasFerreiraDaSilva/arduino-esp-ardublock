Arduino 
========
* Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple I/O
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing and MaxMSP).
The boards can be assembled by hand or purchased preassembled; the open-source
IDE can be downloaded for free at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

* For more information, see the website at: https://www.arduino.cc/
or the forums at: https://forum.arduino.cc/  
You can also follow Arduino on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/arduino or
like Arduino on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/official.arduino

* To report a *bug* in the software or to request *a simple enhancement* go to:
https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/issues

* More complex requests and technical discussion should go on the Arduino Developers
mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/a/arduino.cc/forum/#!forum/developers

* If you're interested in modifying or extending the Arduino software, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas on the Developers mailing list *before* starting
to work on them. That way you can coordinate with the Arduino Team and others,
giving your work a higher chance of being integrated into the official release
